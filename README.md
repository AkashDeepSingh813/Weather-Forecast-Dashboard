🔍 Objective:
The goal was to design an interactive dashboard to monitor real-time weather conditions and Air Quality Index (AQI), enabling users to track environmental metrics, understand pollution levels, and make health-conscious decisions based on live data insights.

🔄 Process:

KPI Development: Key metrics such as Temperature, Humidity, Wind Speed, Visibility, Pressure, UV Index, and pollutant levels (PM10, PM2.5, SO2, NO2, CO, O3) were tracked. Dynamic DAX measures were created to classify AQI levels (Good to Hazardous) along with automated color coding and health suggestions.

Visualizations:

Line Chart: 7-Day temperature forecast trend.

Gauge / Donut Chart: AQI Status Indicator.

Cards: Real-time weather metrics and pollutant breakdown.

Panel Section: Sunrise, Sunset, and Rain Probability.

💡 Insights:
The dashboard highlighted an AQI level of 121 (Unhealthy for Sensitive Groups), with elevated PM10 and O3 levels. Forecast trends indicated rising temperatures with minimal precipitation, suggesting persistent pollution levels.

📊 Conclusion:
This dashboard provides real-time environmental monitoring and transforms raw data into actionable insights, demonstrating advanced DAX logic, dynamic visual design, and data-driven decision-making capabilities.
